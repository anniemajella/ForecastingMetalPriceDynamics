# Forecasting Metal Price Dynamics
Stochastic modelling and forecasting metal price dynamics 

Overview:

This project focuses on the stochastic modelling and forecasting of metal price dynamics, specifically targeting historical steel price data over a period of ten years. Various models including ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and Monte Carlo simulation were compared to predict future metal prices. The goal is to develop and implement a robust Monte Carlo simulation model to generate probabilistic forecasts of future metal prices, taking into account the inherent uncertainty and complexity of the market dynamics.

# Forecasting Metal Price Dynamics
Stochastic modelling and forecasting metal price dynamics 

Overview
This project focuses on the stochastic modelling and forecasting of metal price dynamics, specifically targeting historical steel price data over a period of three years. Various models including ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and Monte Carlo simulation were implemented and compared to predict future metal prices. The goal is to develop and implement a robust Monte Carlo simulation model to generate probabilistic forecasts of future metal prices, taking into account the inherent uncertainty and complexity of the market dynamics.
